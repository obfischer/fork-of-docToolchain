== Creating a New Release

include::../_feedback.adoc[]

=== Before You Begin

- We use https://semver.org/[semantic versioning] and we also keep a https://keepachangelog.com/[changelog]. All of this is done on a best-efforts basis.
- A release consists of five parts, each explained below.

=== GitHub

* run +
`docker run -it -e BATS_LIB_PATH=/usr/lib/bats -v "${PWD}/dtcw:/code/dtcw"  -v "${PWD}/test:/code/test" maxh/bats:latest test` +
to test dtcw
* Update the version in `gradle.properties`.
* Update the version in `dtcw` and `dtcw.ps1`. `dtcw.bat` will be generated
* Update the changelog.
	** Create a section for the version.
	** Copy to the new section all unreleased features which will be in the release.
	** Commit and push the new version.
* https://github.com/docToolchain/docToolchain/releases/new[Draft a new release].
* Copy the contents of the changelog for this version to the description then submit.
* Set the version as **v**X.Y.Z.
* Run `./gradlew createDist` to zip the source in build (the distribution file).
* Add the zipped file and submit the new release.

=== Docker Hub

==== Standard Image

* Update the https://github.com/docToolchain/docker-image/tree/ng-beta/.github/workflows[GitHub workflows] to reflect the new version.
* run https://github.com/docToolchain/docker-image/actions/workflows/standard-build.yml[github action] to build and deploy the image

do the same for the other images

=== Blog Post

Create a blog post to announce the new release. The SDKMAN! announcement will reference it.

=== docToolchain-Wrapper (dtcw)

Everything went well? Great! Now letâ€™s update the wrapper.

Navigate to https://github.com/docToolchain/doctoolchain.github.io/actions/workflows/update-dtcw.yml and trigger the action.


=== SDKMAN!

A GitHub action https://github.com/docToolchain/docToolchain/actions?query=workflow%3A%22sdkman+deploy%22[sdkman deploy] has been created to deploy to SDKMAN!

* Set the version to the same as for the other releases, but without the prepended v: X.Y.Z.
* Use as a download link the link to the `docToolchain-dist.zip` from the GitHub release. Tip: the link looks like https://github.com/docToolchain/docToolchain/releases/download/v1.3.1/docToolchain-dist.zip[https://github.com/docToolchain/docToolchain/releases/download/v1.3.1/docToolchain-dist.zip].
