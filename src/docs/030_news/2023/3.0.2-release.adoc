[TIP]
====
You like docToolchain? +
What about helping to make it even better? + 
docToolchain is a community project, so be part of the community which drives the project. +
You don't have to code for doing so. +
It would even help to brush up the docs, write tutorials or groom the backlog +
(I guess many of the open issues are already fixed).
