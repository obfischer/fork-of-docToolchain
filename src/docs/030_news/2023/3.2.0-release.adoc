== docToolchain release v3.2.0

=== About This Release

Here it is: docToolchain v3.2.0!

We could *reduce* the size of the release by ~70MB compared to v3.1.2 and ~120MB compared to v2.2.1. Additionally we successfully closed a plenty vulnerabilities in the dependencies (11 Critical, 76 High, 129 Medium).

It contains two major changes:

* Clean up dependency tree
** Removed build-in server for `previewSite` task. the task is now a no-op. There is no replacement for the build-in server. Simply open the generated `.html` in your browser.  `previewSite` may be removed in a future release.
** Removed unused dependencies

* Refactored exportJiraIssues and exportJiraSprintChangelog tasks.
** Improved error handling for all Atlassian API calls
** Introduced new configuration option `jira.exports` as a replacement for `jira.requests`. The change is backwards compatible, but the new configuration option is recommended and the deprecated `jira.requests` will be removed soon.
** Introduce configuration option to limit the number of API calls per second to avoid 429 errors

[TIP]
====
You like docToolchain? +
What about helping to make it even better? +
docToolchain is a community project, so be part of the community which drives the project. +
You don't have to code for doing so. +
It would even help to brush up the docs, write tutorials or groom the backlog +
(I guess many of the open issues are already fixed).
