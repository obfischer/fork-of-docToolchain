== ADR-02: Separate core logic from Gradle

=== Status

This decision is currently under ongoing discussion.

=== Problem and Context

The structure of the docToolchain project, is historically grown and has been adapted to the needs of the project. 
The project is built with Gradle. 
Although Gradle is a powerful build tool that allows for a lot of flexibility,
there are some recommendation on how to setup and structure a project, 
docToolchains setup is quite customized only follows few conventions.
The project setup is not very well documented, which makes it difficult for new developers to understand the build process.
Furthermore, the build scripts have become increasingly complex over time, which makes it difficult to maintain them.

Apart from the aforementioned problems, docToolchain is currently very tightly coupled to Gradle, which in some scenarios leads to high startup times, e.g. when running tests.

=== Decision

There has been a vital {github-discussion}[discussion on GitHub] around docToolchain v3, which has led to the decision to separate the core logic from Gradle.
The core logic will be implemented in Groovy and will be used by Gradle.
Gradle, as a first-class citizen, is then considered as a tool to provide a convenient way to use the core logic. 
The core logic will be implemented in a way that it is in the first steps completely isolated from Gradle. 
This paves the road for even further decoupling from Gradle in the future.

This decision has several advantages:

* Developer experience is improved, as the core logic is easier to understand and to maintain.
IDE support is improved, as the core logic is like any other Groovy project, no custom setup required.
* Encapsulating business logic into a dedicated submodule that does not know anything about Gradle or any other buildtool, opens the door for non-Gradle usage.
* Core logic is not splattered over scripts and Gradle task definitions, but is concentrated in a single place.
* Dependencies are easier to manage, as they are defined in a single place.
Gradle buildscripts only have a single dependency to the core logic.
* Tests can be executed without Gradle, which leads to faster test execution.

=== Alternatives

==== Keep the current setup
We could keep the current setup, but this would block to the aforementioned improvements.

==== Separate core logic into Gradle's buildSrc
We could separate the core logic into Gradle's {gradle-buildsrc}[buildSrc].
While this would improve the situation, it would still not solve the problem of having the core logic tightly coupled to Gradle.
Furthermore, it would not solve the problem of having a complex/ slow test setup, since there is still the need for Gradle runner.
On top buildSrc is meant for complex build logic and not for business logic. https://github.com/docToolchain/docToolchain/pull/1208[See this PR for an example]

==== Separate core logic into a separate project
We could separate the core logic into a separate project.
This would solve the problem of having the core logic tightly coupled to Gradle.
While a submodule in the first step is still part of the current project, it relieves the core logic from the need to know about Gradle.
However, some tasks rely on Gradle plugins, this would make it difficult to execute them without Gradle. https://github.com/docToolchain/docToolchain/pull/1226[See this PR for an example]

=== Consequences

As a result of this decision, the setup needs to be migrated to the new structure. This includes:

* Migrating the core logic into a separate submodule
** Revise current implementation
** Logic that solely depends on Gradle plugins should be kept as is to avoid unnecessary effort and reduce the overall scope of the migration
* Migrating the tests into the new submodule
* Adopt the buildscripts to use the new submodule

New features should be implemented in the new submodule.
Gradle Task should only be used to provide a convenient default way to use the core logic.
